// TODO: Complete the list of bugs

/* 
- **Rendering Issue:** When too many tiles (36th-42nd) are rendered, the sound system stops functioning properly. 
  - Test with `testFunction()` + `soundFunc`.
  
- **Tile Count Bug:** After `nextRoundReset`, sometimes a player's hand has only 12 tiles.
  - Check AI hands as well.

- **Riichi Display Issue:** Player 3 occasionally fails to display `riichiIndex` correctly on the board.

- **(Partially Fixed)** Previously, a player in Riichi could wait for two different winning tiles, but only one was accepted for Ron or Tsumo. 
  - Needs verification.

- **Kans Issues:**
  - Sometimes tiles are not added correctly, affecting hand length.
  - Players can Kan immediately after discarding their fourth tile.

- **Debug Hand Verification:**
  - Check [tilesData2[47], tilesData2[38], tilesData2[25], tilesData[16], tilesData[7],
    tilesData[62], tilesData[71], tilesData[44], tilesData[50], tilesData[41],
    tilesData[120], tilesData[121], tilesData[122]].

- **Scoring Issues:**
  - In `scoresScreen`, RON is not working.
  - `calculatePoints()` does not function correctly for RON.

--------------------------------------------------------

// TODO: Complete the to-do list

- **Fix `calculatePoints()`**, as it currently returns incorrect values.
- **Cleanup `useState`** in `PlayerButtonsPanel` after `resetToNextRound`.
- **Initiate AI Turn** automatically after resetting the round.
- **Verify Computer Player States** post-reset.
- **Refactor `PassActionFunc()`** for better efficiency.
- **Align Melded Tiles** properly on the horizontal axis.
- **Investigate Kan Timing:** Ensure players cannot Kan immediately after passing in `PassActionFunc()`.
- **Fix `handleRiichi()` Bug:** Player 3's `riverIndex` is sometimes incorrectly set to 7, and the tile is not flipped.
- **Riichi Index Bug:** If computer player 2 declares Riichi, the same `riichiIndex` is applied to computer player 3 even if they are not in Riichi.  
  - ðŸš¨ **High Priority!**
  
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Add memoization to `WallX` component.
  - Reference: [Redux Memoization Guide](https://redux.js.org/usage/deriving-data-selectors#optimizing-selectors-with-memoization).

- **Deadwall Crash Fix:** Reset `isDora` in `tilesData- TTileObject[]` when going to the next round (reset causes deadwall positioning crash).
