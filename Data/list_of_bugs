/* 
- When too many tiles are rendered on the screen (around the 36th-42nd tile), the sound system stops functioning properly. Test with testFunction() + soundFunc.
- After nextRoundReset, sometimes a player's hand has only 12 tiles. Check AI hands as well.
- Player 3 occasionally fails to display riichiIndex correctly on the board.

- Issues with Kans: Sometimes tiles are not added correctly, affecting hand length.
- Players can immediately Kan after discarding their own fourth tile.
- Verify handling of the following tile data:
  tilesData2[47], tilesData2[38], tilesData2[25], tilesData[16], tilesData[7],
  tilesData[62], tilesData[71], tilesData[44], tilesData[50], tilesData[41],
  tilesData[120], tilesData[121], tilesData[122].
- in scoresScreen RON is ton working, calculatePoints RON is not working

// TODO: Complete the to-do list

- Fix calculatePoints() as it currently returns incorrect values.
- Ensure useState cleanup in PlayerButtonsPanel after resetToNextRound.
- Initiate AI turn after resetting the round.
- After resetToNextRound, verify computer player states.
- Refactor PassActionFunc() for better efficiency.
- Align melded tiles properly on the horizontal axis.
- Investigate if players can Kan immediately after passing in PassActionFunc().
- Debug handleRiichi(): Player 3's riverIndex is sometimes incorrectly set to 7, and the tile is not flipped.
- if computer player2 declares riichi, the same riichiIndex goes to computerPlayer3 even if he is not in riichi
