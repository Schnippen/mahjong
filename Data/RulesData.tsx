export const RulesPlayingFirstParagraph = `The game starts with tiles shuffled into face-down walls. Players take turns drawing a tile, then discarding one, placing it in rows in front of them. Discards are arranged in order, typically six per row.`;

export const RulesPlayingSecondParagraph = `Players may call a discarded tile to complete a set, which must be shown face-up and cannot be changed later. If no one calls the tile, play continues anti-clockwise, with the next player drawing from the wall.`;

export const RulesPlayingThirdParagraph = `The hand ends when a player wins or the wall is empty (except the dead wall). If the dealer wins or is one tile from winning in a draw, they keep the dealership; otherwise, it passes to the right. The game progresses from East round to South round.`;
